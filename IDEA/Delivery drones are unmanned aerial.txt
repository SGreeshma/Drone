Delivery drones are unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used to deliver items, ranging from food, medical supplies, and other consumer goods.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for alternate, secure, and contactless delivery modalities. Due to this, demand for drone delivery services has increased globally.

Drone deliveries utilize GPS to help navigate their way to a customerâ€™s home. Once it reaches its final location for drop-off, built-in cameras and sonar tech help a drone avoid obstacles during flight.

For final delivery, a drone may safely lower the item to a safe location marked by a QR code. Customers can use a specially marked mat to identify this drop-off point correctly. The drone will scan this code to verify the delivery. If successful, the order gets lowered onto the mat. Once , the drone will return to the warehouse, ready for another order. 

By investing in UAV technology, they are speeding up delivery times and allowing integrations with mobile phone applications to enhance their customer experiences.
